****Spectral emissions from a swirl-stabilized and non-premixed methane/air flame****

**ABSTRACT**

This project presents an investigation of the spectral emissions from a swirl-stabilized, non-premixed methane-air flame. The study was conducted to gain a better understanding
of the flame characteristics and the spectral emissions of such a flame, which is commonly used in industrial combustion systems. The effects of swirl number and equivalence ratio
on the spectral emissions were investigated. The experiments were conducted with three configurations of the swirl burner, each with a different annular gap. The results of this
study aim to provide useful information for the reliable development and optimization of combustion systems.
